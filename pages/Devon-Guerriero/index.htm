   <h2 style="color: white;">About Me</h2>
   <p style="color: white;">My names Devon, I'm an EUS student at Ryerson University. I live in Oakville Ontario, and I am 19 years old. I want to grow up and be able to use technology to change our future and become more sustainable. I love Architecture, and it is a possibility that I would want to get a masters in Environmental Design. I also love sports, Hockey, Rugby, and Snowboarding are my favourites. The most exciting place I have ever been is England, I went in April 2012 with my highschool rugby team and it was the best experience I have ever had. We went to London, Oxford, and Bath, toured around and had matchs against teams in each of those towns/cities. I would honestly love to move there and establish myself with a job one day. Anyways, thats a little about me and my life. <a style="color: white;" href="http://www.facebook.com/devonguerriero14">Add me on Facebook!</a>
