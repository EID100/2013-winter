   <p> Welcome to my customized webpage. </p>
   <p> I am currently a third year Marketing major and Finance minor at Ryerson University. I am also the Executive Vice-President of DECA Ryerson which is one of the largest student groups at Ryerson University, and I am the Undergraduate Representative for the Ryerson University Marketing Alumni Association. I am an avid reader and a HUGE toronto maple leafs fan. </p>
