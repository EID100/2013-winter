	<p><h2>Hey there</h2> </p>
	<p> I'm Chika, thanks for visiting my page. Well now that you've come, I suppose it's my task to entertain you. Well, let me start off with introducing myself. I'm in my second year of ACS, streaming in Culture studies, and working towards completing a minor in Professional Communication, and a certificate in Image Arts. In a nutshell, I aspire to one day work in the field of copywriting and art direction, wish me luck! </p>

<p><h2>Fun Facts</h2>
I have an ever growing love of  the Arts, including visual, literary, and performance art. I also absolutely  adore dogs, to the extent that my daydreams commonly involve me laying in a field of puppies. I also throughly enjoy cake, and it too consumes my dreams. On a more serious note, I seriously do love dogs, and art, but also humour. What else? Well, I enjoy obscurely reading into things, doodling about life, and creating random things my mind desires.  
</p> 


<p>Overall, I find myself a creative person, and enjoy mingling with like minded people. Want to connect? </p>
