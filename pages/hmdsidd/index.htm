<h1>About me</h1>
<h2>Hammad Siddiqui</h2>

<p>I am a student at Ryerson University. I am currently enrolled in EID100, a course that is designed to teach us how to use the web in a much more efficient way. Included in this is the creation of this website I am trying to make. By the end of this course, I suspect that I will know much more than I previously did. </p>
