<p>I'm working towards a degree majoring in Biology and minoring in Psychology. I aspire to be a doctor SOMEDAY (why does it feel like it's soooo long into the future), but at present, I'm just an average human being with an above average interest in extreme sports (or so I'm told). So far I've managed to try the Skyfall in Wonderland, but I'm going bungee jumping and this summer since I've failed to find anyone to accompany me and have decided to finally take the plunge myself.. Apart from daydreaming about that, you can find me studying/napping on the 10th floor of the Ryerson Library, planning events for the Ryerson Pre-Medical Society, catching up on world news and politics, and of course TV shows! I'm also very friendly and outgoing, so if you see me in class or outside, don't be shy to say hi, because I definitely will!</p> Â 




<br><br><b>Things I Like </b><br>




<p> Quite a few; I'm a total TV junkie/movie buff at home but also like to be politically aware of what's going on around us..At the same time I'm always self diagnosing myself and love to learn about rare infectious diseases..</p>
