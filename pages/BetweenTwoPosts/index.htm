<h1>Who is the greatest-ever goalscorer</h1>
<p> For years Pele has been considered the best soccer playter to ever live. However, with the modern game growing new stars are beginning to step into the lime light.
Although he has scored 931 goals less, Messi has began to impress fans from all over the world. Questioning whether Pele is still the greatest? Back in the day when
Pele played goals scored was counted much differently, league, tournament, friendlies, internationals all counted towards the total sum, therefore leaving Messi at a bit of a disadvantage.
Do your research and make a decision for yourself. Messi or Pele? </p>
