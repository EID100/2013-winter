<h1>Goalkeeping Fundamentals</h1>

<p>The tactical responsibilities of goalkeepers include:

1. To keep goal by physically blocking attempted shots with any part of their body.
The keeper is permitted to play the ball anywhere on the field, but he may not handle
the ball using his hands outside the penalty area.

2. To take free kicks from deep into their own territory and goal kicks.

3. To organise the team's defenders during defensive set pieces such as free kicks and corners.

4. To pick out crosses and attempted long passes either by punching them clear or collecting them in flight.</p>

<p>The fundamental goalkeeper stance looks like such. Feet shoulder width apart.
Standing one the balls of your feet and leaning your weight forwards</p>
